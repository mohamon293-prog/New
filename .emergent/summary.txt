<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user wants to build a production-ready digital business platform named Gamelo in Arabic.

During this session, the user requested several new features and bug fixes after a successful deployment:
1.  **SSL/HTTPS Fix:** After installing an SSL certificate, the site broke due to API calls using .
2.  **Wallet Deduction:** Ensure the user's wallet is correctly debited upon purchase.
3.  **New Authentication Flow:**
    *   Implement email/OTP verification for new user registrations.
    *   Add a Forgot Password feature.
4.  **Product Deletion:** Ability for admins to permanently delete products.
5.  **Advanced Analytics:** A dashboard with daily/weekly/monthly stats and a reset feature.
6.  **Roles & Permissions (RBAC):** An interface for admins to assign roles and granular permissions to other users.
7.  **Account-type Product Issues:** Fix bugs where non-digital products (accounts) were treated like digital codes (requiring stock) and their delivery status was not handled correctly.
8.  **Excel Import:** Implement a feature to bulk-upload products and codes from an Excel/CSV file.
9.  **Wallet Functionality:** Build a complete user wallet system, including admin tools to credit/debit user balances.

**User's preferred language**: Arabic (العربية)

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack marketplace with a React (Vite) frontend and a modular FastAPI/MongoDB backend. The application is successfully deployed on the user's Hostinger server.

Key systems implemented:
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based login/registration. A new, more advanced flow (email verification, password reset) is currently in progress.
-   **Products:** Full CRUD for products, including three types: , , . Supports bulk import via CSV.
-   **Orders & Delivery:** A complete order lifecycle. Digital codes are auto-revealed post-purchase. Account type products have a manual admin-driven delivery flow where the admin provides credentials and delivery info, which is then shown to the user.
-   **Wallet:** A fully functional user wallet system. Users can purchase with their balance, and admins can credit/debit funds from the admin panel.
-   **Admin Panel:** A comprehensive dashboard with modules for managing users (including RBAC), products (including deletion), orders (including manual delivery), and viewing advanced analytics (daily/weekly/monthly revenue/orders) with a data reset feature.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was implementing a large, multi-part user request. The final actions were focused on building the new authentication flow. The backend logic for email verification and password reset was implemented in . The agent was just starting the frontend implementation, beginning with creating the Forgot Password page.
*   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done**: N (for the new auth flow)
*   **Which testing method agent to use?**: both (The new authentication flow requires significant backend and frontend changes. The testing agent should be used to verify the complete flow: registration -> email verification -> login -> forgot password -> reset.)
*   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1: Complete and Test the New Authentication Flow (P0)**
    *   **Details**: The user requested email/OTP verification on registration and a Forgot Password feature. The backend endpoints (, , , ) have been created in . The frontend work has just begun. This will require an email sending service (e.g., SendGrid, Resend), for which credentials have not yet been requested.
    *   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Ask the user for email service credentials (e.g., SendGrid API key) and add them to the backend environment.
        2.  Create the necessary frontend pages: , , , and .
        3.  Integrate these pages into the React Router in .
        4.  Modify the registration logic in  to redirect to the verification step.
        5.  Call the  to perform a full end-to-end test of the new authentication lifecycle.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This will significantly improve account security and user experience, which are critical for a commercial platform.
    *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    *   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
    *   **Blocked on other issue**: Awaiting user credentials for an email sending service.

*   **Issue 2: Admin Cannot Add Products From UI (P1)**
    *   **Details**: The user repeatedly reported that adding a product from the admin panel results in a  error and a black screen. While the agent created a working  test and improved frontend error handling, the user's final report on the matter indicated it's still an issue.
    *   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Attempt to reproduce the issue by manually filling out the Add Product form in the UI.
        2.  Inspect the network request payload sent from the browser and compare it meticulously against the Pydantic  model in .
        3.  Pay close attention to empty strings vs.  values, and data types (e.g., ensuring prices are sent as numbers).
        4.  Fix any discrepancies in the frontend state management within .
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a core admin function. Fixing it is essential for the user to manage their store.
    *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    *   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1: Complete New Authentication Flow Frontend**
    *   **Where to resume**: The agent was about to create the frontend pages for password reset and email verification. Start by creating .
    *   **What will be achieved with this?**: A complete, secure user registration and account recovery system.
    *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
    *   **Blocked on something**: Email service credentials.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks (P1):**
    *   Internal Messaging/Support System.
    *   Advanced product filtering/sorting on the main site.
    *   Frontend UX Enhancements (e.g., loading skeletons).

*   **Future Tasks (P2 - Backlog):**
    *   Anti-Fraud & Abuse System.
    *   Smart Recommendation Engine.
    *   Scheduled Tasks (e.g., for offers).
    *   PDF Invoice Generation.
    *   Feature Toggles for a/b testing.
    *   Backup & Disaster Recovery plan.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Deployment & DB Solved**: Successfully resolved all deployment (black screen) and production database issues from the previous session.
-   **Product Purchase Flow Fixed**: Resolved a critical bug where products could not be viewed or purchased due to an ID/slug lookup mismatch.
-   **Account Product Lifecycle Implemented**: Created a full-stack flow for manually delivered products (e.g., accounts), separating their logic from auto-delivered digital codes. Admins can now deliver these orders with credentials and notes, which are then displayed securely to the customer.
-   **Wallet System Created**: Built a complete wallet feature from scratch, including backend APIs and UI for both users (view balance, history) and admins (credit/debit user wallets).
-   **Excel/CSV Import Implemented**: Added a feature allowing admins to bulk-import products and their associated digital codes.
-   **Live Homepage Data**: Replaced static mock data on the homepage with live data fetched from the backend APIs.
-   **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: Created a new admin dashboard for viewing daily, weekly, and monthly revenue and order statistics, with a feature to reset the data.
-   **Permanent Product Deletion**: Implemented the functionality for admins to hard-delete products and their associated data.
-   **Roles & Permissions (RBAC)**: Built a comprehensive UI and backend for assigning roles and granular permissions to users.
-   **SSL/HTTPS Fix**: Patched the frontend to use the correct protocol () for API calls.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
*   None. All major issues reported during the session were addressed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
*   None. The deployment issues from the previous fork were definitively solved.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB, Pydantic, JWT, Bcrypt.
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI, Axios.
- **New Concepts:** Email/OTP verification, Password Reset flow via email.
- **Deployment:** Manual deployment to Ubuntu on Hostinger using Nginx and Supervisor.

**key DB schema**
- **users**: Added  array.
- **orders**: Reliably contains , , and  (for delivered account-type products).
- **products**: No schema change, but hard-delete is now possible.
- **wallet_transactions**: (New Collection) .

**changes in tech stack**
- No changes to the core stack. An email sending integration (like Resend or SendGrid) will be required to complete the current task.

**All files of reference**
- **Backend (Modified):** , , , , 
- **Backend (New):** 
- **Frontend (Modified):** , , , 
- **Frontend (New):**  (and upcoming auth pages)

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  script is functional but could benefit from more robust error checking.
- The user has requested many features in rapid succession. A review of the frontend components might find opportunities to deduplicate code, especially around modals and API calls.

**key api endpoints**
- **(NEW)** : Full suite of endpoints for user and admin wallet management.
- **(NEW)** : Endpoints for fetching and resetting sales/order analytics.
- **(NEW)** :  to update user roles and permissions.
- **(NEW)** , , , : New auth flow.
- **(MODIFIED)** : Now performs a hard delete.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **Email Integration Needed:** The current task (new auth flow) requires an external email sending service. You must ask the user for API keys (e.g., SendGrid, Resend) to proceed. This is a blocker.
2.  **Verify Admin Product Creation:** The user has repeatedly stated they cannot add products from the UI. Even though  tests worked, this must be treated as a real, high-priority bug. Reproduce it from the UI's perspective.
3.  **Confirm HTTPS Works:** The agent patched the  to be protocol-relative. You should confirm with the user that this fixed the issue after their SSL installation.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User**: I can't assign roles/permissions to users.
2.  **Agent**: Implemented a full RBAC system in the admin panel.
3.  **User**: My site is broken (404) after installing SSL.
4.  **Agent**: Diagnosed  vs  issue.
5.  **User**: Also, make sure the wallet is debited on purchase. And add email verification for new accounts. And add a forgot password feature. And fix all other bugs.
6.  **Agent**: Acknowledged the large request and started implementing the SSL fix.
7.  **Agent**: Implemented the backend wallet deduction fix.
8.  **Agent**: Implemented the backend logic for the entire new auth flow (email verification, forgot/reset password).
9.  **Agent**: Started creating the frontend Forgot Password page.
10. **(PENDING HUMAN MESSAGE)** The agent has not asked for email service credentials, which are required to complete the current task.

**Project Health Check:**
*   **Broken**: The Add Product functionality for admins is reported as broken. The new auth flow is incomplete.
*   **Mocked**: N/A

**3rd Party Integrations**
*   **Telegram**: Implemented for notifications, but was pending valid user credentials in the previous session. Status is unknown.
*   **(NEEDED)** **Email Service (SendGrid/Resend)**: Required for the in-progress authentication features. No integration has been added yet.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES, multiple  and Python script-based tests were run by the agent to validate backend changes.
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO.
- **Test files created**: None.
- **Known regressions**: User reported that an attempt to fix the account-type product flow broke the display of digital codes. This was subsequently fixed, but highlights the need for careful regression testing.

**Credentials to test flow:**
*   **Admin User**:  / 
*   **User GitHub Repo**: 
*   **User Server IP**: 
*   **User Domain**: 

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent did not ask for credentials for an email sending service, which is a blocker for the current task of implementing email verification and password reset. It jumped straight into backend implementation without confirming this prerequisite.</analysis>
